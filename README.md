# LArSoft_MCRecoTests
First analyzer module to test the reconstruction performance in SBND
Now running on LArSoft v06\_56\_01

# Contents
## MCRecoComp
Initial nTuples containing information about the true and reconstructed vertices

## ParticleGun
To look at the particle gun events

## VtxParameters
Old module for calculating parameters which may characterise the primary vertex for NuMuCC events

## TopologyPrimaryVtx
Main module for calculating parameters which may characterise the primary vertex for NuMuCC0Pi events

## NeutrinoVtxFinder
Main module for calculating parameters which may characterise the primary vertex for NuMuCC events

## SimplePrimary
Using the assumption that the longest track in the event is the primary, get performance parameters 

## fcl [folder]
Fhicl files corresponding to the running of each analyser

## macros, plots [folders]
Directories holding a macro and any plots produced
